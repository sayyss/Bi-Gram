### Data
- input: text file
- Convert words into one-hot encoded vectors
- vocab: all the words in the text file

### Model
- Single matrix size: (vocab size, vocab size) 
- plug one hot encoded vectors into matrix
- pick out the index of maximum number in output
- use pytorch's .backward() to update the matrix

### main
- plugable text file
- able to train using simple procedure 
- able to predict x amount of words using simple procedure 


### Flow
- Get words from text file
- get vocab size -> all unique words in that text file
- create input data -> x = word[i], y = word[i+1]
- create one hot encoded vectors from those words using pytorch's one hot encoding functionality
- initialize model using vocab size
- train the model on the x data, use custom loss calculation if possible or use pytorch's
