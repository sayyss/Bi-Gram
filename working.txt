### Data
- input: text file
- Convert words into one-hot encoded vectors
- vocab: all the words in the text file

### Model
- Single matrix size: (vocab size, vocab size) 
- plug one hot encoded vectors into matrix
- pick out the index of maximum number in output
- use pytorch's .backward() to update the matrix

### main
- plugable text file
- able to train using simple procedure 
- able to predict x amount of words using simple procedure
